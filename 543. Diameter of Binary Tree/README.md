## Description

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the <strong>longest</strong> path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

<strong>Example:</strong>

Given a binary tree
```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
```
Return <strong>3</strong>, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

<strong>Note:</strong> The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.



## Debug
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {

    }
};
```
