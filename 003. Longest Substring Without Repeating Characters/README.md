## Description

Given a string s, find the length of the <strong>longest substring</strong> without repeating characters.

 

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

<strong>Example 3:</strong>
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
<strong>Example 4:</strong>
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

<strong>Constraints:</strong>

- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
