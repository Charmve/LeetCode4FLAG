## Description

Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

``word1`` and ``word2`` may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

<strong>Example:</strong>
Assume that words = ``["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]``.
```
Input: word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”
Output: 1

Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"
Output: 3
```
<strong>Note:</strong>
- You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.


## Debug
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestWordDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {

    }
};
```
