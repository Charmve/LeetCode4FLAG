## Description

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it <strong>loops endlessly in a cycle</strong> which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process <strong>ends in 1</strong> are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

<strong>Example: </strong>
```
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

## Debug
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        
    }
};
```
